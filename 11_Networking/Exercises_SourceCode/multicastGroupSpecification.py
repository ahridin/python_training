#  224.x.x.x upwards is the multicast address area.  Many multicast addresses are blocked by firewalls.
#  This leads to "Operation not permitted" A subset of the multicast addresses (239.0.0.0 upwards) is deemed
#  "local" (cf. the NATable unicast addresses) and these do not get blocked, so use them.
